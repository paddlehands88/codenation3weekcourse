    <h2>2.1. Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed â€“ in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?</h2>
    <p>There are a plethora of IT tools within Coding, and since I have only used such tools for a limited number of weeks I would be unable to make any thorough 
        objective assessment - this would take time and involve me using many other applications to gain an insight into an applications strengths and weaknesses 
        and compare this to other offerings in the market.</p>


<p>As a new programmer I am immersing myself into the application ecosystems and its very apparent different coding languages come and go, and a programmer has to decide what languages to become well-versed to become attractive to Employers. These are the coding languages, and many applications are built around these, and so I would expect to be greater in number and will need to evolve with the dynamically changing market.
</p>
<p>From my limited experience I have used code editor applications such as Atom, Codepen and recently Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Code is very structured and I know is capable of developing bespoke websites. In time I will learn more aspects of code and this will enhance my design capabilities, which in turn will enhance the features I use. All these software applications are free, so I imagine there are software versions or add-ons which cost money and will have enhanced features.
