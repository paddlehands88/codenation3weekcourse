    <h2>Unit 2   1.8 Storing and retrieving files effectively</h2>
    <p>From the perspective of the website, files such as images and icons, all need to be stored within an organised filing system. This is to make it easy when creating the website on VS Code for instance, for referencing images. At present all my images are located in the same file root as my homepage index.html. This has already become very cluttered and for future websites I will likely create separate image files possibly referenced by page to maintain organisation.</p>
    <p>The css/styles.css page should have the css folder located at the same level as the index.html homepage. Each web page needs to have a html boilerplate, and in the <head> section we need to enter link data as shown below to tell the browser where to reference the css styles that have been applied to the website and page in question.
    </p>

    <p>If a page does not include a link like this the page will be displayed simply based on the html code found directly on the page. This would not be good from an end userâ€™s view.</p>
