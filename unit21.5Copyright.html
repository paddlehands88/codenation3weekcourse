    <h2>Unit 2  1.5 Copyright and other Constraints affecting Websites </h2>
    <p>To protect intellectual property that you may create and employ on your website it is important to have a copyright label which is usually displayed in the footer. The legalities of such a copyright will be in regards to statutory personal rights, whereby if you are a business entity this will be different and company law has to be considered.
    </p>
    <p>When retrieving images from the web we have to consider copyright issues. This is a key requirement for business websites, because the unauthorised use of copyrighted material can result in large fines and costs to a business.</p>
    <p>A good idea is to have a glance at the way images and icons have been created, and learn to create such content yourself. This may take learning how to use Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator for instance, but in time will reap dividends in the quality of digital projects.</p>
