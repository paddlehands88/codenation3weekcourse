    <h2>Legal Requirements of Digital Projects</h2>
    <p>GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is an EU measure 
        introduced in 2018. It is concerned with how organisations use 
        individuals’ personal data and has been designed to give people 
        greater control of their data. Non-compliance will result in 
        hefty fines as BA have found after a data breach which will 
        cost them up to €200 million! 
    </p>
    <p>At the heart of the regulation are 8 basic individual rights:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>The right to access</h4></li>
            <p>This means that individuals have the right to request 
                access to their personal data and to ask how their data 
                is used by the company after it has been gathered. The 
                company must provide a copy of the personal data, free 
                of charge and in electronic format if requested.
            </p>
        <li><h4>The right to be forgotten</h4></li>
        <p> if consumers are no longer customers, or if they withdraw 
            their consent from a company to use their personal data, 
            then they have the right to have their data deleted.
        </p>
        <li><h4>The right to data portability</h4></li>
            <p>Individuals have a right to transfer their data from one 
                service provider to another. And it must happen in a 
                commonly used and machine readable format.</p>
        <li><h4>The right to be informed</h4></li>
            <p> This covers any gathering of data by companies, and 
                individuals must be informed before data is gathered. 
                Consumers have to opt in for their data to be gathered, 
                and consent must be freely given rather than implied.
            </p>
        <li><h4>The right to have information corrected</h4></li>
            <p>this ensures that individuals can have their data updated 
                if it is out of date or incomplete or incorrect.</p>
        <li><h4>The right to restrict processing</h4></li>
            <p>Individuals can request that their data is not used for 
                processing. Their record can remain in place, but not be used.</p>    
        <li><h4>The right to object</h4></li>
            <p>This includes the right of individuals to stop the processing 
                    of their data for direct marketing. There are no exemptions 
                    to this rule, and any processing must stop as soon as the 
                    request is received. In addition, this right must be made 
                    clear to individuals at the very start of any 
                    communication.</p>
        <li><h4>The right to be notified</h4></li>
            <p>If there has been a data breach which compromises an individual’s 
                personal data, the individual has a right to be informed within 
                72 hours of first having become aware of the breach</p>

    </ol>

    <p>When browsing websites we will be prompted on many occasions to approve ways in which 
        our data may be used. Below examples of a non-compliant and compliant contact form:

    <p>When planning digital projects, ensure the following is done:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Map the data flows of within an organisation and the proposed digital project</li>
            <li>Determine data you need to keep</li>
            <li>Insert security measures</li>
            <li>Review documentation </li>
            <li>Establish procedures for handling personal data</li>
            <li>Determine a communication plan in case of a data breach</li>
        </ol>
    <p>Even though GDPR may seem like a headache for most digital projects, it can also present 
        opportunities. Demonstrate you care about individuals privacy and show this in product 
        design and delivery.</p>
