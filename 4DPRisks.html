    <title>Why Digital Projects can Fail</title>

    <h2>Why Digital Projects Fail</h2>
    <p>Somewhere between 70% and 90% of digital projects fail. 
        <a href="https://www.enginess.io/insights/why-digital-projects-fail">enginess.io/insights
            /why-digital-projects-fail</a> This online article summarises this as follows:</p>
        <h3>“To digitally transform or run a successful digital project requires significant collaboration”</h3>
    <p>…. and breaks down the failure to collaborate on the following factors:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Failing to account for business processes</li>
        <li>Failing to secure all executive buy-in</li>
        <li>Investing in shiny objects, not customer value</li>
        <li>Poor definition/expectations setting</li>
        <li>Poor vendor selection</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Let’s look at these one by one.</p>

<h4>1. Failing to account for Business Processes</h4>
<p>Organisations will identify a problem and uncover a digital solution, 
    but while the problem may have been solved, it does not integrate 
    well with existing business processes. Staff tolerate the new 
    solution but become resentful and disengaged, especially if there is 
    a lack of post-deployment support. The article goes on to comment:

    “After months of struggle and huge training, implementation, and service fees, 
    the project is abandoned, written off due to “tough internal resistance.”
    </p>

<h4>2. Failing to secure all executive buy-in</h4>
<p>If a project is deployed and it doesn’t have the backing of every executive 
    officer involved in its roll-out, the project is bound to face issues. 
    CEO’s, CIO’s, COO’s etc. all have to be onboard, and the CEO has to 
    take ownership of this to ensure commitment from executives and their department teams.</p>

<h4>3. Investing in shiny objects, not customer value</h4>
<p>This is concerned with getting carried away with something which is cool like a new gadget, 
    and not investing 
    in business or customer value. A fantastic example, often quoted in pub 
    quiz’s, is when the US (during the pace race in the 1960’s) were 
    looking to design a pen which worked in space with zero gravity - the project cost approx 
    $1 million. The Russian’s used a pencil.</p>
<h4>4. Poor definition / expectation setting</h4>
<p>Maybe buoyed by the major silicon valley success stories over the 
    years such as Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Uber… the list goes on, 
    there is a culture of wanting to be on board and not miss out on 
    the next big thing, whether as a financial backer or an executive or team leader. Projects 
    will encompass other projects and the workload will balloon and ultimately become impossible to achieve.
    Expectations have to be managed. Optimism, while great in creating 
    engaging, dynamic and exciting work cultures, has to be grounded 
    sometimes. On a scale running from Pessimism to Optimism, Realism 
    is the sweet spot that executives have to aim for.
    </p>

<h4>5. Poor Vendor Selection</h4>
<p>Careful consideration has to be used when considering the people you work 
    with. Can the vendor be relied upon? Will they prioritise your project or other projects they have in their pipeline? What is 
    the extent of the after-sales service? Due diligence is required here. Look up 
    reviews of the vendor and seek multiple sources.</p>
<p>Many digital projects fail and will continue to fail. This is the nature of innovation - you have to make a lot of 
    rubbish before you make something good.</p>
