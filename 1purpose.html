    <h2>The Purpose of IT in Modern Business</h2>
    <br>
    <p>IT is essential to the vast majority of modern businesses. Whether this is a Sole Trader such as a local decorator, to large multinational corporations like Google, IT is essential. For example, a local decorator could have a website created to advertise their business, explain how they work, show their prices to prospective customers and display images of completed decorating jobs. They will likely use accounting software, such as Quickbooks, to complete and file their annual accounts.</p>
    <p>At the other end of the spectrum large corporations will likely have IT departments that service all IT related issues with other departments. They will have an IT strategy to compliment their corporate/business strategy.

    <p>These machines have helped many supermarkets to significantly reduce staffing costs and improve profit margins.</p>
    <p>When devising a strategy, an organisation will look for opportunities that are presented in their business environments. Business environment factors include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Political</li>
        <li>Economical</li>
        <li>Social</li>
        <li>Technological</li>
        <li>Legislative</li>
        <li>Ecological</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Of all these factors the most dynamic is ‘technology.’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore’s Law</a>, whereby
         processing power capabilities of computer
         chips doubled every year. (This has since been revised to approximately doubling every two 
         years) When technological advancements are made, this changes the 
         business landscape which presents windows of opportunity for organisations to exploit. A good example is mapping 
         software which utilises satellite navigation and real time traffic data to determine the quickest routes for 
         drivers. In London, black cab drivers are required to complete <a href="https://www.theknowledgetaxi.co.uk/">‘The Knowledge’</a> 
          where they spend a number of months driving around London to learn where 
         all streets and roads are, and the best routes to take. This is a costly activity. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber">Uber</a> was originally 
         set up in 2009 (under the name Uber Cab) and through combining a host of 
         technological advancements (Smartphones, GPS etc) Uber has gained a strong market share in the Greater London 
         market to the dismay of Black Cab Drivers.
    </p>
    <p>In conclusion, companies have to adapt to their changing environment, and if they don’t, their competitive advantages 
        will erode eventually leading to business failure.</p>
