    <h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>
    <p>So far I have been testing my website after every change I make. I am in a heavy learning phase and I need to understand the implications of the changes I make. I have been changing the browser window size to check how my website will look on different multimedia devices from phones to tablets and including laptop and desktop computers.</p>
    <p>Testing on digital projects will be in greater detail and across multiple devices. When planning for a project, once a prototype of a product is created this will need to be tested to some extent before being released and used. Otherwise you will run the risk of deploying a faulty product and losing customers who will seek an error free product.</p>
    <p>The scope of testing will depend on the product. For instance if we were creating a mobile phone app and 99% of anticipated users will be using IOS or Android, then these two platforms will need to be tested thoroughly. For the platform with just 1% of users, does it make business sense to dedicate staff and resources toward a market segment which will produce little anticipated revenue? Being available on such a platform may financially incur costs and it may be advisable not to develop the product on such a platform.</p>
    <p>Testing can come in different shapes and forms. Computer game manufacturers will have multiple players play their games and search for bugs and glitches. Market focus groups can be set up to speak with end-users and gain insight into their experiences with a digital product. A beta version of a product could have a limited release and the users could be asked to fill in a questionnaire.
    </p>
    <p>When testing it is important to keep in mind the importance of the area of testing. Is the core functionality of a product being tested, or is it a minor aesthetic aspect of the product which will have little impact on an end user’s experience.
    </p>
    <p>Another way to test is to play devil’s advocate. To test the security of a website you could ask a friend to attempt to hack the site and steal personal information. Security Software firms such as Symantec utilise such approaches to identify possible security breaches.
