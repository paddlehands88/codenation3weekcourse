    <h2>Unit 2   1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</h2>
    <p>When considering the experience of end users, we need to be mindful of those with disabilities. Does the site allow for the text size to be increased for those with visual impairment issues? If animation or video is used, how will those with hearing difficulties be able to view and hear certain multimedia? These are things which should be considered.</p>
