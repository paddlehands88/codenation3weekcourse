    <h2>Achieving Project Outcomes</h2>
    <p>When we approach a new project there will be a reason behind this. 
        For my website, acting as a website consultant, the main aim is to 
        attain work. To do this we want any prospective employer / business 
        manager to look at the website, be impressed upon the content, and 
        then make contact whether by email or phone.</p>
    <p>The website needs to be accessible to any prospective Employer, 
        so we have to pay special attention to the HTML code used. 
        Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) uses HTML to help determine 
        what rank your page appears when certain keyword searches are 
        carried out. Google, Bing, etc. need to provide the most 
        relevant search results to a user so they find the info they 
        are looking for quickly and easily. We can structure our HTML 
        code in a way to help this process and get further up Google’s 
        or Bing’s search results. Let’s say that we have found the most 
        used search term when someone is looking for a website 
        consultant is ‘digital consultant.’ We can make this the title 
        of our homepage which will raise its ranking for this search. 
    </p>
    <p>CSS has been used to create the contact forms at the end of each page. 
        A metric that we would look at would be the number of visitors to 
        the site and the conversion rate of those who used the contact form 
        and made contact (due to their interest in the consulting services.) </p>
    <p>CSS is concerned with the styling of a website. Some of the styling features of my website which have been created using CSS are as follows:</p>
    
    <img src="code cityscape.png" alt="Code for Cityscape Image">

    <p>This maintains the width of the cityscape to the total width of the page being viewing. This allows the image to be responsive and look good on small screened mobile phones as well as desktops and laptops.</p>

    <img src="code h1.png" alt="Code for h1">
    
    <p>For my h1 element I have inserted padding at the top of 50 pixels. This will likely be consistent through-out the website. The font-family being used is a modern technological font known as ‘Roboto Condensed.’ If this is not available for some reason, the page is instructed to revert to a basic sans-serif font. The colour of the text is the same as the base of the cityscape image to promote consistency and a professional look.
    </p>
    <p>All the styles on the website are centrally located on this styles.css page. This makes it easy to lookup the various styling elements. The names used should be descriptive so that they are easy to reference and change, especially for someone else who may need to view and make changes to your code.
    </p>
    
    <p>Trello is a project management tool. All tasks for a project are categorised 
        into three categories:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>To Do - Tasks not yet begun</li>
            <li>Doing - Tasks that have begun and are in progress</li>
            <li>Done - Completed tasks</li>

        </ol>
    <p>These tasks are displayed on a ‘board’ which can be named after 
        the project - for example - Website. A project such as creating 
        a website involves many tasks and this software helps to 
        organise this work. This can then be used to organise a person’s 
        schedule of the work they are to do. Trello boards can also be 
        used by teams with multiple users, and a project manager could 
        use it to check on the status and progression of a project.
