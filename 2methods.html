    <h2>Digital Project Methods, Skills & Resources</h2>
    <br>
    <p>The most important asset to any organisation is People.</p>
    <p>When organisations get it right, their people will be highly 
        productive and motivated to achieve digital project objectives. 
        This has to be considered on an individual level, but more 
        importantly at a collective level to achieve synergy. 
        Team-working practices can be summarised as follows:</p>

    <p>Managing and executing such methodologies is challenging but if a project team can get this right, 
        objectives will be achieved and surpassed.</p>
    <p>Different projects will require different skill-sets and resources. This could be hard skills such as understanding different 
        programming languages or how to send an email, but also includes 
        soft skills such as critical thinking, creativity; interpersonal 
        skills such as motivating others and leading by example. </p>
    <p>Staple resources in modern businesses include computer terrminals 
        (desktops, laptops, tablets, smartphones), printers and scanners etc and 
        also associated software (Operating Systems, Word Processors, Spreadsheets, Email etc).
    </p>
    <p>Digital project teams' choice of software will be dependent on 
        projects aims and objectives. Programming teams will utilise 
        Stack Overflow (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow.com</a>) 
        when troubleshooting programming related issues. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla Development Network (MDN)</a> is a 
        key resource for referencing different components of a programming 
        language. <a href="https://github.com/">Github.com</a> is a website which allows programming teams to collaborate, and is used by 40 million developers worldwide.
    </p>
    <p>While the choice of resources are important, it is imperative project 
        teams and the individuals within them are mindful of the overall 
        aim and objectives they are working toward to maintain 
        individual and collective focus.</p>
