    <p>The website has intentionally been designed with simplicity as a driving factor. A major issue of websites today is they contain too much text. I would say most website users are impatient, and if a page takes a couple of seconds to load up, they may well move on to another site. People want to use websites that empower them and are pleasurable to use. If a site is content heavy with a lot of text such as a news website, considerations have to be made to break up this text, illustrate it highlighting key quotes and the use of inforgraphics, even videos. Take bbc.co.uk; when they do a story it will contain many links to connected stories. They will have a ‘analysis’ section at the end of each story where the author gives their opinion on the story. There is also in depth stories that can take 30 min to read. These types of stories are interspersed with graphics and videos to add depth to the content. Also, the text has been slightly greyed so it is easier on the eyes with less contrast with the white background. This is something I should replicate in my site.
    </p>
    <p>There is a considerable amount of content on the website which needs to be summarised to a greater degree, and have images and icons to break up the text. Key headings could be used to give an overview of a number of paragraphs. 
    </p>
    <p>A portfolio section of the website needs to be introduced to exhibit the work I am to do. Obviously I have few websites or coding projects to call upon, and this is something I can incorporate into the website once I have completed projects under my belt.</p>
    <p>Another enhancement would be some functionality demonstrating my mathematical ability. At the heart of coding is data management and creating the systems to manipulate data. Mathematical tools and techniques are at the forefront of data manipulation techniques. Being able to demonstrate this with some functionality on the website would help demonstrate this.</p>
    <p>When reflecting on the website and overall design concept, I think there could be far greater personalisation by utilising some of my hobbies with the website. A large part of meeting someone new is getting to know them, what motivates them and what interests them - maybe some common ground can be established which helps break the ice when meeting face to face for the first time. In regards to this I could have used hobbies such as running or films - themes which can help bring people together. Who doesn’t like films?
