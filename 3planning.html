    <h2>Digital Project Planning & Execution</h2>
    <p>When carrying out a task / project, how we go about this will 
        depend on the size and complexity of the task. A task such as 
        ‘opening a door’ doesn’t require planning - we just do it. 
        However, when approaching a project which contains multiple 
        tasks, or may not have even been defined yet, we must put plans 
        in place to carry out and complete the project. If we don’t 
        then we may run into problems whilst completing the project, 
        problems which can cost time and money. This is captured in the 
        7P’s of planning:</p>
        <br>
        <h3>“P*$$ poor planning produces p*$$ poor performance”</h3>
        <br>
        <p>When beginning a large project such as building a website, it’s 
            a good idea to understand the problem. This phase can be called 
            the research phase. If building a personal CV website, look at 
            other people who have done the same on google. Speak to people - 
            family, friends… who may have some insight into the project.
        </p>
    <p>Once we understand the problem we can map it out by listing all the 
        tasks that are required. Next to each task we can put an estimated 
        duration (hours/days) and also what other tasks need to be done 
        before the task can start. For instance, you may need access to 
        the internet, therefore you need to contact an internet provider 
        and have the internet set-up before you begin. Trello is a great 
        tool for listing tasks, dividing them into ‘To Do,’ ‘Doing’ and 
        ‘Done.’ <a href="https://trello.com/b/7uSDhWJb/code-nation-1-9th-march">
            My Trello Board Link</a> </p>
        <p>Trello can also be used to allow multiple people to have access 
            to the same Trello board. This is a great way to coordinate teams 
            and help ensure accountability.</p>
        <p>Once we have a list of tasks and their dependencies we can carry out
             ‘Critical Path Analysis.’ Critical Path Analysis shows us the list 
             of critical tasks in our project that have to be completed to 
             prevent any delays occurring. Let's say we want to have a cup of 
             coffee. First we want to list all the tasks, their dependencies 
             and their estimated duration:</p>
        <img src="Coffee Task List.PNG" alt="Coffee Task List">
        <p>Then we can illustrate this in the following way:</p>
        <img class="screenshots" src="Crirical Path Analysis Coffee.png" alt="Coffee CPA">
        <i>Critical Path Analysis of making a cup of coffee</i>
        <p>The way this flow-chart has been created is mapping each task with a 
            double-box, and linking each of the tasks depending upon their 
            dependencies. For instance, we need to fill the kettle with water 
            (task A) before we can boil the kettle (task B.) These flow-charts 
            generally flow from left to right based upon time. Each link is 
            represented by the time it takes to complete the task from the 
            link(s) that leave on the right hand side of each of the boxes. 
            Each box represents the point in time at the start of the task - 
            like a photograph / time-stamp.</p>
        <p>These boxes are populated in the top space/box with the earliest 
            start time (EST) working from left to right. All tasks with no 
            dependencies will be given the value ‘0,’ and then we move along 
            to the next task, add the duration in time of the task, then 
            populate the next task box with the EST for that task. This is 
            done for all of the top boxes. We then repeat this process, but 
            work backwards from right to left and filling in the bottom box, 
            which represents the latest starting time for each activity. Once 
            complete we can identify the critical path. The critical path 
            represents the set of tasks which if delayed, will delay the whole 
            project. This means we can identify these task, prioritise them in 
            our workflow, and then manage all other tasks accordingly.</p> 
        <p>Benjamin Franklin once quoted ‘time is money,’ or Time = Money, and 
            this is to Business what Einstein’s E = mc² is to Science. Performing 
            Critical Path Analysis (CPA) helps us to organise our workflow to be 
            efficient and cost-effective, ultimately saving costs and maximising 
            profits. When a project has hundreds of tasks and multiple people 
            working on them, using CPA can make a substantial difference.</p>
        <p>Finally, a great way to illustrate tasks and their dependencies, are 
            gantt charts. In a gantt chart, our coffee making would look like 
            this:</p>   
        <img class="screenshots" src="Coffee Gantt Chart.png" alt="Coffee Gantt Chart">
        <p>Here we can see the critical tasks illustrated using red. We can see 
            the key task is the boiling of the kettle which will take 180 seconds. 
            We can also see other tasks such as adding coffee, sugar and milk, are 
            all being done whilst waiting for the water to boil.</p>
        <p>While analysis tools can be beneficial, it’s important to not get bogged 
            down with analysis. “Paralysis by Analysis” can occur when over 
            complicating the planning process and spending too much time 
            planning, and not enough time doing. In the words of Richard Branson, 
            sometimes we should simply:</p>
