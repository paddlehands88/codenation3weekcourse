    <h2>2.2.  Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello</h2>
    
    <p>Trello is a fantastic tool to manage your work, but is it as good as having a To-Do List at hand? There’s a certain satisfaction to having a tangible daily list which can fit in your pocket and when you complete a task you get to cross out or tick-off the list… or both! So far I have been working independently, and as a tool to self organise I am still making to-do lists and using these as a lynchpin of my work progress. When other team members are involved on a project, or a manager wants to understand my status on various work projects, then a Trello board will far outweigh a traditional to-do list.

    <p>Visual Studio Code has been great to use in my experience of learning to code. I like the way it structures code and colour codes different elements. The file menu in the left hand window is helpful when sourcing images and various other files. There are a multitude of shortcuts to learn, and since VS Code incorporates html, css, javascript and many other languages, it might be prudent to stick with this software and become efficient and effective in using it by learning the shortcuts and becoming more productive.
