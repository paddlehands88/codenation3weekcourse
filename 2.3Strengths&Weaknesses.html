    <title>Strengths & Weaknesses</title>

    <h2>
        2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project â€“ are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?
    </h2>
    <p>I am happy with the first website I have solely designed. I say solely designed in the sense I have designed websites before but created them using generic website builder applications - such as WordPress. </p>
    <p>The website functions as intended and is simple in design. It looks professional making good use of space and having a consistency in the use of menu bars and images. I feel I am a creative person, yet I understand the robust functionality required at the core of a website is of greater importance, and the flair and creativity needs to be used to enhance and humanise this functionality.</p>
    <p>At its core the website is intended to encourage Employers to contact me with the intention of using my services and ultimately employing me. The contact forms are therefore a key aspect to achieving this. Much of the site is geared to enhancing my credibility as a IT consultant such as the blog posts, and are easily accessible from the home page.
    </p>
    <p>Some weaknesses of the website are concerned around security. Although personal details are limited to what a person submits on one of the contact forms, this has to be considered. The email address or any other personal details need to be secure. Does the website expose my email account to being accessed with authorisation?</p>
    <p>There are other limitations which I believe will be easily resolved. For instance, presently on the homepage, there are image icons which have been stretched in width, and since some of the icons utilise circles, this is clearly evident as the circles are stretched along their horizontal axis. Small details like this have to be considered. An Employer may look at this aspect of my site and have the view that I am incapable or lazy in having icons which have been stretched. It is critical in designing any product that we consider the user-experience. What are the questions that a user asks themselves, sometimes subconsciously, when they encounter the various aspects of a website? When involved in website design you have to be mindful of all possible experiences different users have with their unique personal disposition.</p>
