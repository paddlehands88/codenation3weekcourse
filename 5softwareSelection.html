    <h2>Choice of Systems and Software</h2>
    <p>When choosing IT systems and software the following process can 
        be followed:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Define your Needs</h4></li>
            <ul>
               <li>Define what problems you want your 
                   IT systems and software to solve</li>
                <li>Further define this list into 
                    ‘must have’ and ‘would like to have’</li> 
            </ul>
            <br>
        <li><h4>Establish a Shortlist</h4></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Search market / websites and make a list of those providers 
                    that meet your requirements</li>
                <li>List pro’s and con’s of each</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
        <li><h4>Understand the Pricing</h4></li>
            <ul>
                <li>The cheapest is not always the best. Ask which systems//software 
                    offers the best VALUE</li>
                <li>Examine vendors pricing policy - What is free and what is paid for?
                </li>
                <li>Understand the anticipated product life span and the anticipated 
                    maintenance costs.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
        <li><h4>Ask for a Demo</h4></li>
        <p>For IT systems look to speak with a vendor’s previous customers. Give them a 
            call or better still, visit their premises and speak with end users face to 
            face. Schedule a demo with each vendor and have a list of predefined questions 
            you would like answering. Some essential questions would include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Can the software integrate smoothly with existing systems?</li>
                <li>Can the software be customised?</li>
                <li>What support is there if I have issues needed to be resolved quickly?</li>
                <li>What is the process for software updates and upgrades?</li>
            </ul>
        <li><h4>Make a Choice</h4></li>
        <p>When making a decision to go ahead, ensure you are not only comfortable with the IT 
            systems and software, but also the vendor too. You want to begin a relationship 
            with the vendor whereby you can call upon them for all your future IT requirements. 
            If you are not comfortable with the vendor, carry on searching.</p>
            
        
    </ol>
